In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other gaming stocks.\n\nThe gaming industry has experienced significant changes over the past few years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sector saw remarkable growth as more people spent time indoors. However, this momentum did not continue after restrictions eased, which led to lower consumer spending on games and consoles. Economic uncertainties and challenges like inflation further impacted the industry, resulting in layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations across the industry in 2024. Despite these setbacks, analysts are optimistic about a recovery supported by upcoming major releases.\n\nREAD ALSO: 8 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Buy Right Now and 20 Best Fintech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.\n\nAccording to research firm Newzoo, video game consoles are expected to be the biggest growth driver in the market until 2027. The anticipated launches of GTA VI in fall 2025 and the new Switch console in summer 2025 are seen as key factors fueling a rebound. GTA V, the predecessor to GTA VI, is one of the most profitable games ever and has sold over 210 million by December 2024. Analysts believe new releases will encourage players to spend more on consoles and games. This could potentially reverse the industry\u2019s recent slowdown.\n\nAccording to the report by Newzoo, console software revenue is projected to increase 7% from 2024 to 2027 and outperform PC software revenue growth of 2.6%. By 2027, console revenue is expected to account for over 56% of the total PC and console software revenue of $92.7 billion. Total playtime increased by 6% in 2024 and Q4 saw the highest quarterly playtime thanks to blockbuster releases like the new Call of Duty title.\n\nEmmanuel Rosier, director of market analysis at Newzoo, told Reuters that major console titles, such as Spider-Man and God of War, are driving engagement on consoles. He also pointed out that these AAA or AAAA releases have less impact on PC gamers, who prefer older titles.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best gaming stocks to invest in according to billionaires, we looked for the largest gaming companies. We reviewed our own rankings, financial media reports, ETFs, and various online resources to compile a list of the best gaming stocks.

It is currently the only company offering paid rides in the U.S. and has been expanding to new cities. It has also begun to take share in more established markets like San Francisco as customers become more comfortable with the technology. While Alphabet needs to drive down the prices of its technology, it is clearly the leader in this emerging space.\n\nAI Overviews should eventually lead to new monetization opportunities. Historically, Google has only displayed ads on about 20% of its searches, with cost-per-click being a big source of its ad revenue. However, it uses other ad formats through its AdSense platform, such as display, text, and video ads, and could use these types of ads to generate revenue for its AI Overviews. It also operates the Gemini generative AI chatbot. While still behind some competitors, the chatbot is starting to improve and catch up. The company is also ahead in some AI areas, such as text-to-video, where its Veo 2 platform has demonstrated strong results, given its training on YouTube videos.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is leaning heavily into AI. The company owns the world's third largest cloud-computing platform where it helps customers develop their own specialized AI models and applications through its Vertex AI platform. The platform enables customers to use Gemini or other foundational models as a starting point. Alphabet is also using Gemini to help improve its search results and power its AI Overviews.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet owns YouTube, the most watched streaming service. As a stand-alone entity, YouTube is the fourth largest digital advertising platform in the world. The company's model of sharing advertising revenue with its creators reduces heavy upfront content spending and leads to strong profitability.\n\nWhile known for its Google search engine, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has a strong collection of businesses. Google is still its prized possession and for good reason. It holds about a 90% global market share for search and is the world's largest digital advertising platform. While there are a number of AI-powered competitors looking to make inroads, none have the scale of users or network of advertisers that Google has.\n\nLet's look at two AI stocks that investors can buy and hold for the next decade.\n\nFollowing the recent market pullback, a number of high-quality tech stocks based in artificial intelligence (AI) are now trading at more attractive prices. This is a great opportunity to purchase shares of these market-leading companies.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEven further out, Alphabet is a leader in quantum computing with its Willow chip. Last year, the company made a major breakthrough in the space. One of the big issues with quantum computing is that it is error prone especially as it scales, but Willow has begun reducing errors as it scales. Quantum computing is still far from commercial applications, but this once again demonstrates how Alphabet is a technology-leading enterprise. The ability to innovate and adapt is the key for turning a tech company into a good, long-term investment.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nLike Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a collection of market-leading businesses with strong AI ties. The company was one of the first big tech companies to embrace AI when it made a large investment in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and partnered with the start-up.\n\nMicrosoft's use of OpenAI's AI models has helped drive its own cloud business, Azure. The platform provides customers with the infrastructure to train their own AI models while offering AI-powered analytics, security, and management tools. Though the business has been capacity-constrained, Microsoft is spending heavily building out data centers to keep up with demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has incorporated AI assistant copilots throughout its offerings. The biggest push has been with the copilots for its Microsoft 365 subscription service, which includes access to its popular work productivity tools, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The company is advancing how its copilots can help workers become more productive. A cost of $30 per month per enterprise user presents a big opportunity for the company moving forward. The company also recently added new security AI copilot agents, extending its market for AI copilots.\n\nWhile Microsoft has relied on OpenAI, it isn't standing still. It has been reported that the company is developing its own in-house AI reasoning models, as well as starting to work with other third-party models. This will help reduce its dependence on OpenAI and allow it to use its own AI models to help power its copilots going forward.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft and OpenAI's partnership agreement runs through 2030, and the two companies remain close. However, the software giant is clearly looking ahead; having its own internal AI model options certainly gives it future leverage.\n\nMicrosoft has also developed its first video game AI model called Muse. It will look for the AI model to help speed up new game development, as well as possibly preserve classic games that can be used on modern hardware. Gaming is a big business for Microsoft through its Xbox hardware and gaming studios, including Activision Blizzard. It will be exciting to see how it will incorporate AI into its games and make them better.\n\nWhile Microsoft continues to see solid growth through the help of its AI offerings, the possibilities of what comes next are what makes the stock attractive. The company has been very adaptive over the years, transitioning to a subscription-as-a-service model for its productivity software and then later as one of the first big tech companies to embrace AI.\n\nIt is this ability to plan ahead and adapt that makes Microsoft a stock to buy and hold for a long time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

According to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, \"Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the internet.\"\n\nWall Street has taken notice: Many AI, or AI-adjacent companies, have been on fire for the past two years, but they recently collectively took a bit of a dive due to industry-specific issues. Earlier this year, a China-based company called DeepSeek developed an AI chatbot with far less money and resources than some of the leaders in the field, which rocked the industry. Market wide headwinds have also played a key role in the recent dip. President Trump's trade wars could impact businesses across various sectors and harm economic activity.\n\nThough these headwinds are genuine, the recent drop represents a good opportunity to purchase shares of top AI stocks on a slight dip, at least for those with excellent prospects. That's the case with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). These two are part of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" and are still excellent buy-and-hold options even with market caps near $3 trillion.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple was a latecomer in AI. The tech company announced it would add a suite of AI features -- dubbed Apple Intelligence -- to some of its latest devices and operating systems. By the time it did, some companies were already earning meaningful revenue from their AI-related work. Further, Apple's grand entrance into the field didn't impress many investors and analysts. We are still waiting to see whether and to what extent it will lead to a renewal cycle for the company's iPhone and other gadgets. However, Apple often takes its time releasing tweaked versions of existing technologies -- the result is usually a hit.\n\nThe iPhone wasn't the first smartphone, nor were AirPods or the Apple Watch the first of their kind -- but all of these products became incredibly popular. Apple has several strengths that could allow it to make noise in AI. First, it boasts a massive ecosystem of 2.35 billion active devices that's just begging to be monetized in umpteen different ways. Second, and relatedly, Apple has one of the strongest brand names in the world.\n\nEven if some of its AI-related initiatives aren't original, they could still attract significant attention because of the company's brand. Beyond AI, Apple will use its strengths to pursue many growth paths. It now supports more than a billion paid subscriptions within its services segment. Some of these are in industries with excellent long-term prospects, such as fintech. And as Apple's high-margin services unit grows in prominence, it will work wonders for its bottom line.", "language": "en", "sentiment": "positive", "confidence": "0.6454977989196777", "stock_name": "Apple"}, {"link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-aapl-mega-cap-195823989.html", "source": "finance.yahoo.com", "title": "Is Apple Inc.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other mega cap stocks gaining bullish momentum this week.\n\nThe S&P 500 index started the week with a bang after staying under pressure for a few days. There was a realization that Wall Street may have overestimated the impact of tariffs. Once the dust settles, the market will continue to go higher, just like the US economy which continues to grow despite challenges.\n\nWhen the broader market corrects itself due to uncertainty, such as the one brought about by Trump\u2019s tariff wars, mega-cap stocks also get affected. This provides investors, especially the ones that invest at regular intervals, to take another bite of these impressive stocks. The same situation happened during the last week, and we believe that after Monday\u2019s impressive recovery, the trend is about to reverse.\n\nMega cap stocks like the ones in our list have driven the market in recent months and are therefore likely to be the ones leading it again. We decided to come up with the top 10 mega-cap stocks in the S&P index that have lost a considerable chunk of value in the last month and are now trading at a discount, a valuation gap that could quickly be recovered during this week\u2019s trading.\n\nTo come up with the list of 10 oversold S&P 500 Mega-Cap Stocks To Trade This Week, we only looked at stocks with a market cap of at least $200 billion that have lost the most value in the last month.\n\nIs Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Mega Cap Stock Gaining Bullish Momentum This Week?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) operates as a manufacturer, designer, and marketer of personal computers, wearables, smartphones, tablets, and accessories. The company provides iPhone, iPad, Mac, and wearables. It also offers AppleCare support and cloud services.\n\nLike any other good company, Apple stock continues to trade at a ridiculous valuation despite a 10% downturn in price within a month. According to a recent report published by Morgan Stanley, Apple is among a handful of stocks that are ideally placed to sustain an economic downturn. However, the fact that it is also expensive makes it a tough decision for long-term investors.\n\nThere are quite a few things that should soothe investors when talks of a bubble come around. A major difference between the current high valuations and the ones during the dot-com bubble is that valuations then were based on non-financial metrics like viewers and clicks.
